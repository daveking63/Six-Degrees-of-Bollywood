# Six-Degrees-of-Bollywood
Think of 6 Degrees of Kevin Bacon -- only this time, it's a social network analysis (SNA) of the actors and directors of Bollywood movies from 1970 to the present.

This project looks at the social networks among the cast and directors of Bollywood movies for the 50 years from 1970-2018 (the modern era).  It is a reincarnation and expansion of an earlier project that was part of a tutorial on social network analysis (SNA) conducted at HICSS-47 (2014). That tutorial looked at social networks in Bollywood movies for a small sample of films from 2008-2013. The slides from that earlier tutorial are provided here for reference. This current rendition expands the sample size of movies being analyzed but also looks at some additional factors underlying their network structure including the prominence of well-known <i>Bollywood families</i>.

The genesis of that intial project and this expansion is found not only in the simple games, applications, and research revolving around the "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon", but also the larger body of SNA including the concepts of degrees of separation, clustering, and small world networks (see:
