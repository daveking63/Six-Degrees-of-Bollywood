# Six-Degrees-of-Bollywood
Think of 6 Degrees of Kevin Bacon -- only this time, it's a social network analysis (SNA) of the actors and directors of Bollywood films from 1970 to the present.

This project looks at the social networks among the cast and directors of Bollywood films for the 50 years from 1970-2018 (the modern era).  It is a reincarnation and expansion of an earlier project that was part of a tutorial and workshop on social network analysis (SNA) that I conducted at HICSS-47 (2014). That tutorial looked at social networks in Bollywood movies for all the Bollywood films from 2008-2013. The slides from that earlier tutorial are provided here for reference. This current rendition expands the sample from 6 years of films to the 49 years of films from 1970 to 2018.

The genesis of my initial work, as well as this expansion, is found not only in the simple games, applications, and research revolving around the "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon" (based on Hollywood films), but also the larger body of SNA including the concepts of degrees of separation, clustering, and small world networks:

</ul>

The project involves three intertwined phases. The first phase focuses on the creation of the data set on which the SNA analysis is based along with a brief statistical overview of the data set. The second phase is devoted to a SNA of this dataset -- looking primarily at who works with whom and who the key players are from a SNA perspective. Finally, the third phase combines this data with another data set based on 'Hindi Film Families' in order to look at the participation and influence of these families in Bollywood films. The analysis in all 3 phases is housed in 3 separate Jupyter iPython notebooks.
